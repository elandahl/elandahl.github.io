*Voice your opinions about the Idea Realization Lab*

Come be a part of our open forum to discuss your suggestions for the space, student needs, event ideas, questions, or anything else involving IRL. 

There will be ~FREE FOOD~ 

IRL promotes thinking through making. Help us fit your needs!  We aim to create an open student community, but we can't do this without you! 

Estimated time is an hour, but feel free to stay and mingle after.

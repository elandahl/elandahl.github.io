title: Hack2Impact, a hackathon for social good at the IRL in February

*Create solutions to issues facing the Chicago community in mentored teams*

Over the last weekend in February, students and alumni of several Chicago-area schools will come together and form teams of diverse talents, from developers and engineers, to designers and business students.

Assisted by the [Chicago Community Trust](http:http://cct.org/) and DePaul’s [Office of Mission and Values](https://offices.depaul.edu/mission-and-values/Pages/default.aspx), area professionals will each present issues facing the Chicago community. Over the weekend, professionals will mentor their team to develop a prototype or other solution to address the need.

The hackathon will conclude on Sunday with each team presenting their creation, judged by representatives from the community partners. Winners will receive money and work space at the Idea Realization Lab to continue their project.

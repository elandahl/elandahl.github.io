*Enjoy coffee and donuts while sharing project ideas*

 
Looking for ideas for your next project? Have a project or inspiration you would like to share? Want to hang out with other creative students from DePaul while enjoying free coffee and donuts? Come to AM Inspirations!

This fall, the Idea Realization Lab is hosting AM Inspirations, a social event on select Friday mornings that allows DePaul students to share their ideas and get inspiration from other students while hanging out in the brand new 4500 square foot IRL space and enjoying refreshments. Speakers can include current students, DePaul alumni, and local creatives. 

October's event will feature UX Designer/HCI graduate student Sup Suh, and a vinyl sticker making demo by Theresa Boyle.

Doors open at 10am, with talks starting at 10:30am.

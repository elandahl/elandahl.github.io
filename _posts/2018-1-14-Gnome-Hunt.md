title: Use a Makerspace to decorate your Gnome for the DePaul Gnome Hunt
---

*Sew clothes, build wearable electronics, or 3D print accessories for your DePaul Gnome*  

The [Inaugural Gnome Hunt](https://orgsync.com/29891/news_posts) will be taking place from February 5-9, 2018! Students will have the chance to find gnomes decorated by organizations and offices. Once you find a gnome, simply bring it to the Office of Student Involvement to receive a DePaul t-shirt and Chartwells gift card.

If you are part of a student organization or office that would be interested in decorating a gnome, submit a [request for a gnome](http://orgsync.com/121494/forms/297481) by January 19.

Bring your Gnome to the IRL or MakerHub!

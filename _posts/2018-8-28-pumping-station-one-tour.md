Join the staff and class of LSP 111: The Maker Movement in Chicago for a field trip to Pumping Station: One.

Pumping Station: One is a hackerspace located in the Avondale neighborhood at 3519 North Elston Avenue, Chicago. The organization was started in April 2009 with 30 people in a coffee shop. Our membership of more than 480 people gather in a facility that is about 11,000 square feet.

Our school bus departs promptly at 2:00 pm from the street in front of the [IRL](irl.depaul.edu), 14 E. Jackson, and in front of the Barnes and Noble bookstore. A valid DePaul ID (student/faculty/staff/alumni/friend) is required to participate in this field trip, and you will have to sign a travel waiver once you get on the bus. We aim to return to the Loop at 4:00 pm. There are only limited spaces availabe; [registration](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/field-trip-to-pumping-station-one-chicagos-oldest-and-largest-hackerspace-tickets-49711986891) must be completed before September 16.

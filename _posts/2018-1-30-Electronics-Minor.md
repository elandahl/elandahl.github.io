title: Begin your Electronics Minor Spring Quarter with Intro to Digital Electronics
---

*No previous Physics or Electronics experience required*

This minor will teach you to design and troubleshoot electronic circuits.  Students may start the minor with either PHY 232 (Introduction to Digital Electronics), offered Spring Quarter, or PHY 110 (Basic Electronics), offered Autumn Quarter.

## Spring Quarter Meeting Times for PHY 232 ##

*Mondays 1:00 - 4:10 and Wednesdays 1:00 - 2:30*

*Electronics Lab and Studio Classroom, Byrne Hall, Lincoln Park*

*No previous Physics or Electronics coursework or experience required*


## Course descriptions

### PHY 110 BASIC ELECTRONICS: PRINCIPLES & TECHNIQUES

*Introduction to analog electronics that develops the basic principles needed to understand consumer electronics. Emphasis is given to audio applications, but the same basic principles are the foundation of modern computer technology.  LSP 120 or HON 180 or (MAT 130 or above) or consent of instructor is a prerequisite for this course.*

### PHY 231 LINEAR ELECTRIC CIRCUITS

*Frequency response and feedback, operational amplifiers as linear amplifiers, active filters, oscillators, communication circuits and data conversion circuits.  PHY 110 is a prerequisite for this course.*

### PHY 232 INTRODUCTION TO DIGITAL ELECTRONICS

*Principles of combinational logic circuits. Boolean algebra and Boolean function simplification. State diagrams and sequential logic circuits, and MSI devices. Digital circuit prototyping using SSI components.  LSP 120 or HON 180 or (MAT 130 or above) or consent of instructor is a prerequisite for this course.*

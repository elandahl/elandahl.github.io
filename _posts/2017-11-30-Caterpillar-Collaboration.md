*Newsline article: DePaul program certifies employees on makerspace equipment*

From the article:

> If you had access to a makerspace, what would you make? More companies are posing this question to their employees, resulting in state-of-the-art spaces that lead to the development of new innovative products. DePaul's Jayson Margalus has become a sought-after expert on advising companies how to best incorporate makerspaces into everyday work life.

> Caterpillar, the construction and equipment company based in Peoria, Illinois, is one example.

> After opening a makerspace in 2016, Caterpillar reached out to Margalus for help training its employees. The collaboration led to the development of a program that certifies employees on makerspace equipment, including laser cutters and 3D printers. The certification allows employees to build parts and tools for mining equipment, diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines, diesel-electric locomotives and other tools used by the company.

> "This program is exclusive to DePaul," says Margalus, who is an instructor in the College of Computing and Digital Media. "It gives Caterpillar the opportunity to train employees trained in all of the state-of-the-art equipment."

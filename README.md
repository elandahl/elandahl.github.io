Written using **Jekyll**, a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub hosted blogs ([Jekyll Repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)).  

Based on the **Jekyll Now** template that makes it easier to create Jekyll blogs by eliminating a lot of the front setup ([Jekyll Now Repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)).
